============

Scripts for working with deployable ipython notebooks.

Run `ln -s hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit` to enable commit-time output checks

## Rakefile directions

Each ipython notebook should have an accompanying rakefile with a matching name,
e.g. `df.ipynb` and `df.rake`. That rakefile should declare a task `:deps`, which
will be run to fetch any dependencies for the notebook. `:deps` should probably
not do anything but depend on other local files, which should be generated by
other tasks. Here's an example:

```ruby
file :some_data do
    sh "wget go/some_data"
end

file :other_data do
    sh "impala -f query.sql -o other_data"
end

file :joined_data => [:some_data, :other_data] do
    sh "join some_data other_data > joined_data"
end

task :deps => :joined_data do
end
```
